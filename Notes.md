#   Sorting

1. Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
2. Insertion Sort - O(n^2) --> Stable
3. Merge Sort - O(n^log(n)) --> Stable
4. Quick Sort - O(n^log(n)), Worst case is O(n^2)
5. Heap Sort - O(n^log(n))
6. Counting Sort - O(n)
7. Radix Sort - O(n)


#   Important algorithms to note

1. Kadane's Algorithm (to find maximum subarray sum)
2. Kane's Algorithm (Graph topological sorting)
